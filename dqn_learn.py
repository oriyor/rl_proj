        # should consist of current observations, current actions, rewards,
        # next observations, and done indicator).
        # Note: Move the variables to the GPU if avialable
        # 3.b: fill in your own code to compute the Bellman error. This requires
        # evaluating the current and next Q-values and constructing the corresponding error.
        # Note: don't forget to clip the error between [-1,1], multiply is by -1 (since pytorch minimizes) and
        #       maskout post terminal status Q-values (see ReplayBuffer code).
        # 3.c: train the model. To do this, use the bellman error you calculated perviously.
        # Pytorch will differentiate this error for you, to backward the error use the following API:
        #       current.backward(d_error.data.unsqueeze(1))
        # Where "current" is the variable holding current Q Values and d_error is the clipped bellman error.
        # Your code should produce one scalar-valued tensor.
        # Note: don't forget to call optimizer.zero_grad() before the backward call and
        #       optimizer.step() after the backward call.
        # 3.d: periodically update the target network by loading the current Q network weights into the
        #      target_Q network. see state_dict() and load_state_dict() methods.
        #      you should update every target_update_freq steps, and you may find the
